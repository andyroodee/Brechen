A Breakout clone for Dreamcast. Created for "One Game A Month" in January 2013 (http://www.onegameamonth.com/)

I started work on the 12th and finished on the 28th. It is presented as-is, but does include code for a bare-bones level editor.

Makes extensive use of KallistioOS, and libtsunami in particular.
